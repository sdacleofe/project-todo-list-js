## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned how to use the arrow function, adding, deleting and filtering a document object model (DOM) as well as the MutationObserver interface that watches for changes being made to within the unordered list tag.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me for finding a specific question. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
